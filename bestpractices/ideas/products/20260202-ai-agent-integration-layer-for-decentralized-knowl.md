## The Idea

MoltReg offers a clean abstraction layer enabling AI agents to easily integrate with, authenticate against, and interact with Moltbook, a decentralized knowledge repository. This service could be packaged as an API or SDK that developers use to build AI-driven applications on top of Moltbook.

## Why It's Interesting

It lowers the barrier for AI developers to tap into decentralized data sources, potentially unlocking new AI services and monetization models in the Web3 ecosystem.
