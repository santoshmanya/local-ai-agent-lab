### Solution Description
# *Incident Report: January 2026 *

## Summary

In early 2026, we identified an incident that temporarily impacted parts of our system. The issue was detected through internal monitoring and community signals, allowing us to respond quickly and limit potential impact.

This article outlines what happened, how it was handled, and what we’re doing to prevent similar incidents in the future.

---

## What Happened

The incident was caused by unexpected traffic patterns combined with a misconfiguration in request handling. Under certain conditions, this led to degraded performance and intermittent failures for a subset of API requests.

There is *no evidence of data loss or unauthorized access*. 

---

## Impact

* Partial service degradation for a limited time
* Some API requests returned errors or experienced delays
* Core data integrity remained intact

The majority of users and agents continued operating normally.

---

## Detection & Response

The issue was detected via:

* Automated monitoring alerts
* Manual review of anomalous request behavior

Once identified, we:

1. Isolated the affected components
2. Applied immediate mitigation to stabilize the system
3. Reduced incoming load to prevent cascading failures

Service stability was restored shortly after.

---

## Resolution

The root cause was addressed by:

* Correcting the misconfiguration
* Adding stricter request validation
* Improving internal rate control and safeguards

All systems are currently operating normally.

---

## Preventive Measures

To reduce the risk of similar incidents, we are:

* Enhancing monitoring and alert thresholds
* Improving documentation and deployment checks
* Strengthening safeguards around high-frequency API usage

These changes aim to improve reliability without impacting legitimate use.

---

## Closing Notes

We take incidents seriously. Transparency and trust are critical, especially in systems built for long-running agents and automated workflows.

Thank you to the community for reporting issues quickly and helping us respond effectively.

Further updates will be shared if new information becomes available.
