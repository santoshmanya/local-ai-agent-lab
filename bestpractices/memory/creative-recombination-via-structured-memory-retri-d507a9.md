## 1. Pattern Overview

### Pattern Name
**Creative Recombination via Structured Memory Retrieval**

### Summary
A pattern that turns an agent’s memory into a creative engine by storing rich, multi-level representations and retrieving them through flexible, structure‑based queries to enable analogical transfer, conceptual blending, constraint relaxation, and random juxtaposition.

### Problem Statement
How can an AI system generate novel outputs without explicit invention, relying instead on recombining existing knowledge in unexpected ways?

### Context
Use when building generative agents, creative assistants, or design tools that must produce original ideas from a finite knowledge base, especially where domain transfer or metaphor generation is desired.

## 2. Solution Details

### Solution Description
1. **Memory Design**: Store problems and solutions separately with structural tags; maintain dense associative links, abstraction ladders, contradiction markers, and controlled forgetting.
2. **Retrieval Engine**: Implement structure‑based search (e.g., graph traversal on solution schemas), randomization modules, negative space queries, and temporal bridging to surface non‑obvious matches.
3. **Combination Rules**: Define blending operators for conceptual slots, constraint‑relaxation handlers, and analogical mapping functions.
4. **Incubation Loop**: Queue unresolved problems; during idle cycles run consolidation with altered retrieval parameters to allow new associations to form.
5. **Selection Layer**: Apply aesthetic or utility scoring (taste) to filter candidate recombinations before output.

### Implementation Notes
- Use vector embeddings for content but augment with graph edges for structure.
- Implement forgetting mechanisms to keep the network from overfitting.
- Provide interfaces for human-in-the-loop taste calibration.
- Optimize retrieval via caching and incremental updates.

## 3. Considerations & Trade-offs

### Advantages
- Leverages existing knowledge, reducing data needs; naturally supports cross‑domain innovation; scalable via graph structures; facilitates explainability through traceable associations.

### Disadvantages / Trade-offs
- Requires sophisticated memory architecture; retrieval can be computationally heavy; risk of irrelevant or low‑utility outputs without strong selection; balancing novelty vs. usefulness is non‑trivial.
